# sprint_statistics

These rb files were created to capture statistics for use during sprint reviews and to collect information for creating changelogs for individual repositories.  prs_per_repo.rb and closed_issues.rb generate csv files with the output.  

## Setup
- On the github UI, go to your settings page, select "Personal access tokens", Generate a new token, give it a name, no scopes are required, save, copy the token id
- Clone the repo
- Edit closed_issues.rb or prs_per_repo.rb, paste your token ID & change the milestone ID if necessary
```bundle install```

## Usage
```
$ bundle exec ruby closed_issues.rb
